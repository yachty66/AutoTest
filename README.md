# AutoTest


Eigeninitiative

i want to create a test for an ideology e/acc (Effective Accelerationism). the idealogy can be defined as following:

"Accelerationism is simply the self-awareness of capitalism, which has scarcely begun. ("We haven't seen anything yet.")
1. The overarching goal for humanity is to preserve the light of consciousness.
2. Technology and market forces (technocapital) are accelerating in their power and abilities.
3. This force cannot be stopped.
4. Technocapital can usher in the next evolution of consciousness, creating unthinkable next-generation lifeforms and silicon-based awareness.
5. New forms of consciousness by definition will make sentience more varied and durable. We want this.
6. Technology is leverage. As it advances, it becomes easier to extinquish all conscious life in our corner of the universe.
Attempting to stall progress isn't risk free.
7. Society and the individual's context within it are rapidly changing, which leads to greater societal instability and mind viruses. (deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation).
8. Those who are the first to usher in and control the hyper-parameters of AI/technocapital have immense agency over the future of consciousness.
9. HUMANS HAVE AGENCY RIGHT NOW. WE CAN AFFECT THE ADVENT OF THE
INFLECTION IN THIS PROCESS.
10. Effective Accelerationism, e/acc, is a set of ideas and
practices that seek tomaximize the probability of the
technocapital singularity, and subsequently, the ability for
emergent consciousness to flourish. There is much work to be done in defining cause areas, motivations,
and philosophy. Please join us on #eacc twitter, and let's work
towards a hundred trillion meta-organisms flourishing in the galaxy."

the test should show the test taker how much he corresponds to this ideology. how would you design this test?












i want to create a test for an ideology e/acc (Effective Accelerationism). the idealogy can be defined as following:

Accelerationism is simply the self-awareness of capitalism, which has scarcely begun. (“We haven’t seen anything yet.”)

The overarching goal for humanity is to preserve the light of consciousness.

Technology and market forces (technocapital) are accelerating in their power and abilities.

This force cannot be stopped.

I am a bit apprehensive about all of this, and I ofc understand why other ppl are too. 

But the train isn't slowing down. You cannot reengineer the economy to avoid this. You cannot melt the GPUs. Every problem must be solved online.

Technocapital can usher in the next evolution of consciousness, creating unthinkable next-generation lifeforms and silicon-based awareness.

New forms of consciousness by definition will make sentience more varied and durable. We want this.

Technology is leverage. As it advances, it becomes easier to extinguish all conscious life in our corner of the universe. Attempting to stall progress isn't risk free.

Society and the individual’s context within it are rapidly changing, which leads to greater societal instability and mind viruses. (deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation).

Those who are the first to usher in and control the hyper-parameters of AI/technocapital have immense agency over the future of consciousness.

We have to do something. To which accelerationism can only respond: You’re finally saying that now? Perhaps we ought to get started?

HUMANS HAVE AGENCY RIGHT NOW. WE CAN AFFECT THE ADVENT OF THE INFLECTION IN THIS PROCESS.

Effective Accelerationism, e/acc, is a set of ideas and practices that seek tomaximize the probability of the technocapital singularity, and subsequently, the ability for emergent consciousness to flourish.

@BlochChinas at least in our conversation, we focused on post-humanist angles. There is a fractal optimization algorithm that created life, intelligence, and every meta-organism we know. Effective accelerationism is aiming to expand the scope and scale of this dynamic multiscale adaptation

i can just do kakd 




instead of completely automating the thing it would be better. i just need a discord channel where i can release my stuff and chat with people. this is pretty fun. i can try to build the biggest discord around creative AI projects which exists lol. 


me: "do you know the political compass test https://www.politicalcompass.org/test/en?"

me: "i want to create my own test which i want to call "how does your state look like?". it should basically be a test that asks questions about how a person would design their own state. in the end, based on the answers, a plot is created showing the spectrum of where a person would be located. do you think it would be possible to create such a test?"





i can basically can create all sort of tests and than release them in a streamlit basically. 

the background of the page literally exists of a bunch of humans which represent different personalities. this would be kinda funny actually. what is the input of the test going to be? this is something which definetely can go kinda viral and over time i can get a bunch of users from that and at some point i am going to publish some kind of product around the twitter account which would be kinda funny. this is going to be a fun project.

people automatically can generate tests. 



- input 
- define possible outputs 
- based on possible outputs generate questions and weight the possible answers strongly disagree to strongly agrees
- display results
    - plot
    - string

 

this is kinda interesting. i can make some cool streamlit / gradios which than go wild 


i am going to build a imperium of twitterbots lolf


what i literally can do is that i allow other people to make a pull request on github and in this way they can add a test which i than cross post on twitter

i am a little bit meh because ideally i wanna do something really triggy like learning reinforcement learning or doing a fine tuning of something


i need a input for what the text should meassure and 

basically replicating https://www.idrlabs.com/tests.php but with llms
