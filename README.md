# AutoTest

- [ ] design for box with question and checkboxes
    - make only one box checkable - 
    - give whole box a appropriate max width and center radios - 
    - set question appropriately - 
    - make a attractive submit button - 
    - throw an error if submit button is clicked but somewhere a checkmark is missing - 
- [x] add title, description and disclaimery
- [x] one dim plot
- [x] set title etc
- [x] deploy the gradio
- [x] make convenient CLI for launching a test
- [x] clean code up so that everything makes sense and people can understand code
- [ ] make the plot working 
    - if i have a int of 20 for e/acc and int of 0 for decel than the plot should work -
    - decel and acel both 5 should be neutral -
    - decel 20 and acel 0 should be clear - 
    - decel 15 and acel 5 should work - 






- [ ] create website where tests from github code are getting released
- [ ] create launch video with sick ass demo software 
- [ ] support two dimensional test

would be cool to have a .project file which is linked to a github project where you can add markdown to this file and than 

i should just spec out all the task on github than it looks more like a company and i can delegate tasks to other people

in the next steps i need to adjust prompts so that it is really working. 



1. I believe that the advancement of technology is inevitable and unstoppable. [Effective Accelerationism]
2. I believe that the advancement of technology is inevitable and unstoppable. [Effective Accelerationism]
3. I believe that the advancement of technology is inevitable and unstoppable. [Effective Accelerationism]
4. I believe that the advancement of technology is inevitable and unstoppable. [Effective Accelerationism]
5. I believe that the advancement of technology is inevitable and unstoppable. [Effective Accelerationism]

hey. in this life everything is godÂ´

i want to create a test for an ideology e/acc (Effective Accelerationism). the idealogy can be defined as following:

"Accelerationism is simply the self-awareness of capitalism, which has scarcely begun. ("We haven't seen anything yet.")
1. The overarching goal for humanity is to preserve the light of consciousness.
2. Technology and market forces (technocapital) are accelerating in their power and abilities.
3. This force cannot be stopped.
4. Technocapital can usher in the next evolution of consciousness, creating unthinkable next-generation lifeforms and silicon-based awareness.
5. New forms of consciousness by definition will make sentience more varied and durable. We want this.
6. Technology is leverage. As it advances, it becomes easier to extinquish all conscious life in our corner of the universe.
Attempting to stall progress isn't risk free.
7. Society and the individual's context within it are rapidly changing, which leads to greater societal instability and mind viruses. (deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation).
8. Those who are the first to usher in and control the hyper-parameters of AI/technocapital have immense agency over the future of consciousness.
9. HUMANS HAVE AGENCY RIGHT NOW. WE CAN AFFECT THE ADVENT OF THE
INFLECTION IN THIS PROCESS.
10. Effective Accelerationism, e/acc, is a set of ideas and
practices that seek tomaximize the probability of the
technocapital singularity, and subsequently, the ability for
emergent consciousness to flourish. There is much work to be done in defining cause areas, motivations,
and philosophy. Please join us on #eacc twitter, and let's work
towards a hundred trillion meta-organisms flourishing in the galaxy."

the test should show the test taker how much he corresponds to this ideology. how would you design this test?
